    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Cheesy beef enchiladas are both spicy and savory, perfect for any meal!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>half of one onion</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno</li>
        <li>1 can enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>1 packet taco seasoning</li>
        <li>6 small tortillas</li>
        <li>a lot of cheese</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees</li>
        <li>In a frying pan, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering, approximately 5 minutes</li>
        <li>While oil is heating, dice onion and jalapeno. Remove seeds and membranes from jalapeno to make enchiladas less spicy, leave them in for more spice</li>
        <li>Once oil is hot, add onion and jalapeno, cook until softened, approximately 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Move onion and jalapeno to the edge of the pan, add ground beef and break apart with spoon</li>
        <li>Stir onion and jalapeno into ground beef and cook until all the beef has browned</li>
        <li>Drain beef fat from pan, add 2/3rd cup of water and taco seasoning to pan</li>
        <li>Cook until liquid is mostly reduced and beef and vegetables are well seasoned, stirring occasionally</li>
        <li>While reducing liquid, add half the enchilada sauce to the bottom of a baking dish such as a dutch oven or casserole dish</li>
        <li>Once seasoned beef is done, fill tortillas with beef, enchilada sauce, and cheese. Roll the enchiladas up and place them in the baking dish on top of the enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining enchilada sauce on top of the enchiladas and cover the sauce with a lot of cheese</li>
        <li>Bake the enchiladas in the oven until everything is hot and the cheese is all melted, approximately 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove the enchiladas and let them cool before serving them with a garnish of sour cream, cilantro, pico de gallo, and whatever you would like</li>
    </ol>
