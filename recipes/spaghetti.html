    <p>Spaghetti with Italian Sausage and a little bit of spice to it!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 28oz cans of peeled San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 pound of spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>1 8oz can of tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 bulb of garlic</li>
        <li>5 Italian sausages</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp oregano</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat olive oil on medium heat until shimmering, approximately 5 minutes</li>
        <li>While oil is heating up, dice the onion and mince the garlic</li>
        <li>Once oil is shimmering, add sausage to the pot and cook for 5 minutes, then flip and cook for 5 minutes on the other side. The sausage will not be fully cooked at this point, but that is ok, we will finish in later steps</li>
        <li>Remove sausage from pot, put in on a plate in the refrigerator to stop cooking</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic and constantly stir until fragrant, approximately one minute</li>
        <li>Add diced onion and stir occasionally until onion starts to turn translucent, approximately 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes, stir to incorporate and cook an additional 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Empty the cans of San Marzano tomatoes into a bowl and crush them with your hands until they are small tomato chunks, then add the bowl of tomatoes to the pot with the other ingredients</li>
        <li>Take the sausages out of the fridge and chop them into bit size chunks. Add the chopped sausage and any of their juices to the sauce, stirring everything to incorporate</li>
        <li>Reduce heat until the sauce is just simmering. Cook for 1 to 2 hours</li>
        <li>Once the sauce has been cooking for at least 1 hour, boil some water in a separate pot and add the spaghetti, cooking til al dente, approximately 8 minutes</li>
        <li>Drain spaghetti and add noodles and butter to the sauce, stirring everything together</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let sit for a few minutes to cool</li>
        <li>Serve spaghetti with parmesan cheese and garlic bread, enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
